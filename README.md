# Neural-Artworks
Combination of Artificial Intelligence and Art

Artificial Intelligence continues to surprise us every day. In this project, I developed an open source code and made it better.

## So what is this Neural Artworks?

Neural Artworks is an open source machine learning project written in python language. He redraws the photographs that we put in the final version that I developed, which do not mean anything, by making them look like real works of art. And it turns out to be an excellent masterpiece. These works of art create works that you have never seen before.

## So what kind of artworks does it produce?

You can see some examples from the photos I have given below.

We add an ordinary image to the content image section. Then we put an artwork that we want to resemble in the style image part. Then it uses artificial intelligence to transform the ordinary painting into a real masterpiece.

It produces excellent results not only in this type of photography, but also in Portraits.

## So how can I use this project?

ðŸ‘‰First of all, this project runs on GPU. We will use Google Colab for this. 

ðŸ‘‰First of all, we add our project to Google Colab. Then we open it with Colaboratory.

ðŸ‘‰In the Runtime section, click on Change runtime type. And we select the GPU and save it. Then we say connect.

ðŸ‘‰We go into tmp from the files section and import our content and style photos into it.

ðŸ‘‰Then we specify the location of the content image and style image from the code section on the 5th line.

ðŸ‘‰Finally, we run our project by pressing Ctrl+F9. That's it.
